        <h2>Albert Fry</h2>	
	<p>
	Dear world, it's been an amazing ride.  Things have gone swimmingly.  
	But I have something to say.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once we were men and women, yes, but surrounded by nature.  
	Now we are surrounded, more and more by each other.
	We become our world.  Well, let's make this world a great one.
	Let's make our surroundings great to be around.  
	And since we are our own surroundings, what means that we need to become
	great to be around.   
	And we can only do that by being kind.
