	<h1>Just be kind</h1>
        <h2>Albert Fry</h2>	
	<p>
	Dear world, it's been an amazing ride.  Things have gone swimmingly.  
	But I have something to say.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once we were men and women, yes, but surrounded by nature.  
	Now we are surrounded, more and more by each other.
	We become our world.  Well, let's make this world a great one.  
	Let's make the future better than the past.  
	And we can only do that by being kind.
